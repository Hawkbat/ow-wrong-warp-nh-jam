		<Text>POKE: If my time-keeping is correct, Quercus is expecting another resupply run. Is anyone on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>]]> available for a quick shuttle trip?</Text>

		<Text>YARROW: I hope he makes good use of those components he "borrowed." If we are not able to complete the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ash Twin Project</color>]]>, at least the technologies we developed will see some use.</Text>

		<Text>POKE: You <![CDATA[<i>are</i>]]> familiar with the workings of the Ash Twin warp towers, correct? The warp to Quercus' craft follows the same principle, only the alignment is between <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>]]> and <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>White Hole Station</color>]]>. As long as you launch your shuttle within that window, you will arrive there safely.</Text>

		<Text>CLARY: To be technically correct (the best kind of correct), the alignment is with Quercus' craft itself, not with <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>White Hole Station</color>]]>. With how far he has traveled, the window should be fairly forgiving (about a minute or so).</Text>
